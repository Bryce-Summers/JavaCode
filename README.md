# JavaCode
This Repository seeks to efficiently keep track of my Java code.

This is an unorganized and unseparated repository containing a subset of the code that I have written in JAVA.
This is where my most recent java code. As such I cannot guranteed that all of the code contained within this repository is currently working,
because I gradually change things and don't fix older projects unless I decided to do some more work on them.
I am planning to gradually separate these projects into separate repositories in the future which will make them more stable and will allow me to write more specific documetation for each of them in the hope that someone out there might want to use them.

# Notable projects
Here is a writeup of some 'featured' projects contained within this repository in the hope of helping you the reader to get excited enough about this conglomerate repository to delve into it and discover the cool things hidden inside of it.

You may want to look at the 'code base' which contains
- My personal implementations of data structures. [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/Data_Structures)
- Many implementations of number types for my personal computer algebra system. [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/BryceMath/Numbers)
- Lots of other code related to Mathematical Structures and Concepts. [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/BryceMath)
- My original java game engine. [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/Game_Engine)
- Lots of work with rendering 2D and 3D images. [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/BryceImages) Includes an implicit description of an Englist Horn! [Image](https://flic.kr/p/Bvjb26) [Code](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/blob/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/BryceImages/ColorCalculators/RayMarching/ColorCalculators/ccEnglishHorn.java)
- A programmatic font system for rendering Bryce Font2 [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/blob/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/Game_Engine/Engine/text/ccAlphabet.java)
- Lots of useful utility functionality such as parsing strings in java, opening files, making screen compatible buffered images, constructing 2 dimensional arrays of a generic type, etc [Link.](https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/Major%20Projects/Code%20Base/src/util)
- Much, much more. FIXME: Add more documentation for the Code base...
